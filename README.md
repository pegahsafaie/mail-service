## About 

This service is written using express and nodemailer.
It publishes an endpoint /sendEmail.
calling this endpoint you can and sends emails from an email to another email.  
I publish this endpoint on Heroku(it lests you deploy NodeJS) and use this for my portfolio contact form

THE_PASSWORD="your password"
```
